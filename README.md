## 📌 Overview

**SkillSync** is an all-in-one student management and career accelerator tailored for engineering and university students. It eliminates campus friction by unifying timetable management, attendance percentage monitoring, academic progress tracking, ATS-ready resume generation, peer doubt exchange, and Gemini-powered AI career mentoring into a single cohesive platform.

Built with performance, strict data isolation, and enterprise-grade security at its core.

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. 📊 Smart Command Center & Attendance Tracker
- **Attendance Margin Calculator**: Instantly calculates your attendance margin against 75% or 85% university requirements, showing how many lectures you can safely miss or must attend to avoid condonation/detention.
- **Subject-Wise Performance**: Real-time interactive charts displaying performance metrics across all registered semester subjects.
- **Study Streak Counter**: Visual progress rings tracking daily productive study hours and unbroken streaks.
- **Upcoming Lecture Widget**: Next-class schedule alerts synced with your weekly timetable.

### 2. 📚 Study Hub & Practice Test Engine
- **Timed Mock Tests**: Dynamic exam simulator with randomized question pools, countdown timers, and immediate score breakdowns.
- **Curated Subject Hub**: Visual academic roadmap covering core subjects (Data Structures, DBMS, Cloud Architecture, Operating Systems).
- **Topic Knowledge Checks**: Self-paced interactive quizzes with rationale explanations for wrong answers.

### 3. 📄 Dynamic ATS Resume Builder & Analyzer
- **ATS-Compliant Templates**: Generates professional, single-page, recruiter-approved technical resumes.
- **Profile Data Auto-Sync**: Pulls verified skills, CGPA, semester milestones, and projects directly from your profile.
- **AI Keyword Density Analyzer**: Audits your resume against target job descriptions and highlights missing industry keywords.
- **Client-Side High-Res PDF Export**: Instant, zero-server PDF generation via `jsPDF`.

### 4. 🎯 Career Roadmap & Placement Readiness
- **Company-Specific Roadmaps**: Curriculum targets mapped against hiring benchmarks of Tier-1 and product companies.
- **Skill Gap Evaluator**: Identifies missing libraries, concepts, and project types required for your target engineering domain.
- **Placement Readiness Score**: Weighted assessment of GPA, practical coding assessments, and resume completeness.

### 5. 💡 PeerSolve Doubt Resolution Hub
- **Campus Community Q&A**: Post technical questions, attach code snippets, and receive peer solutions.
- **Gamified Reputation System**: Earn credits, badges, and verified status by answering doubts from other students.

### 6. 🤖 Gemini 2.5 Pro AI Career Mentor
- **Context-Aware Chatbot**: Mock interview preparation, syllabus debugging, and career advice.
- **Safe Evaluation Engine**: Rate-limited AI queries with sanitized responses and math-expression parsing.

## 🛡️ Security & Privacy Engineering

SkillSync enforces strict production hardening to ensure zero credential or state leakage:

- 🔒 **Client-Side PBKDF2 Password Hashing**: Passwords undergo 100,000 iterations of SHA-256 derivation via the Web Crypto API before local caching. Plaintext passwords are never saved.
- 🧹 **Strict XSS Sanitization**: All user inputs (notes, doubt posts, attendance updates) are sanitized using `DOMPurify`.
- ⚡ **Client-Side Rate Limiting**: Built-in sliding-window limiter blocks brute-force login attempts and restricts AI token consumption.
- 🚫 **Offline-Safe Guard (`Offline404Page`)**: Detects network disconnects and cleanly displays a 404 security blocker to prevent stale, untracked offline state corruption.
- 🗄️ **Per-Account Data Isolation**: Multi-tenant state isolation in Zustand stores guarantees that switching accounts completely flushes and isolates private user data.
- 🔑 **Zero Secrets in Git**: Enforced via `.gitignore`, environment variable management (`.env`), and GitHub Secret Scanning.

## 🎨 Design System

SkillSync follows a calibrated **Emerald Obsidian** visual language:

| Token | Hex Code | Role |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary** | `#10B981` | Vibrant Emerald Green |
| **Secondary** | `#14B8A6` | Soft Teal Accent |
| **Accent** | `#84CC16` | Bright Lime Accent |
| **Dark BG** | `#021814` / `#022C22` | Deep Obsidian Night |
| **Surface Card** | `#062B23` / `#064E3B` | Glassmorphic Dark Emerald Card |
| **Typography** | `Poppins`, `Inter`, `Fira Code` | Headings, Body, and Metrics |
